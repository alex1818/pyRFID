pyRFID
============
An example of using the serial port to read an RFID tag and play a corresponding sound file using Python.

This example was used as the basis of the [2015 Boston University College of Engineering Societal Impact Capstone Award](http://www.bu.edu/eng/2015/05/12/ece-senior-design-team-wins-top-eng-societal-impact-award-2/) winning RFID room entry announements system installed by Boston University ECE seniors at the [Boston Carter School](http://www.williamecarterschool.org/) for students with special needs. 

This system helped the students learn cause/effect as a they waved an RFID tag as they entered a door and they heard a personalized voice announcement from a loved one with the student's name and the room name they are entering.
